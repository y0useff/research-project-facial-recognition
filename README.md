In recent years, the development of intelligent robotic systems capable of detecting and tracking individuals using computer vision and artificial intelligence has gathered attention in the field of robot-assisted applications. Such intelligent and collaborative robots that operate in the vicinity of humans make significant strides in various public and private sectors. This workin-progress paper discusses a preliminary integrated robot system that utilizes a lightweight object detection and facial recognition techniques, namely OpenCV Haar Cascade, VGGFace and other navigation and tracking packages to enable a robot to search, identify and follow a person based on real-time streaming video and sonar sensor inputs. This study establishes a preliminary model to enable seamless robot and human cooperation in unknown environments.
